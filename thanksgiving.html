        <h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
        <h2>1/23/26</h2>
        <p>Today, I am feeling thankful because I woke up in the morning.
            Then, I went on a run and called my mom.
            I am also thankful for the great food I was able to eat,
            and that I was not in despair. Even when I'm tired, I
            should not give up trying to be the best version of myself. For that,
            I am thankful.
        </p>

            The last few days I was so physically sick and in despair.
            I am thankful because I woke up today feeling a bit better.
            I also had more clarity, so I am thankful for that.
            I am thankful that I had a dream about my sister that in the middle of the night
            I felt love and remembered my family and what matters to me.
            I am thankful that I am able to lead an extraordinary Life
            with extraordinary people by my side.
            I ams so thankful that I was born into my family, for that is the gift
            that keeps me going through the toughest times of my life.
