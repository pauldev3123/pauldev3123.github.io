        <h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
        <h2>1/23/26</h2>
        <p>Today, I am feeling thankful because I woke up in the morning.
            Then, I went on a run and called my mom.
            I am also thankful for the great food I was able to eat,
            and that I was not in despair. Even when I'm tired, I
            should not give up trying to be the best version of myself. For that,
            I am thankful.
        </p>
        <h1>1/26/26</h1>
        <p>
            The last few days I was so physically sick and in despair.
            I am thankful because I woke up today feeling a bit better.
            I also had more clarity, so I am thankful for that.
            I am thankful that I had a dream about my sister that in the middle of the night
            I felt love and remembered my family and what matters to me.
            I am thankful that I am able to lead an extraordinary Life
            with extraordinary people by my side.
            I ams so thankful that I was born into my family, for that is the gift
            that keeps me going through the toughest times of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lord, I pray that today you will fill me with joy that doesn't depreciate.
            Lord, I have been so depressed that I have ran out of tears.
            Lord, I know that my faith and righteous actions have dwindled,
            but I believe that you will make me better.
            I need to believe that because I see that otherwise there is no hope.
            It is not about escaping here and being good in NY, I want to be blessed by You 
            in every single step that I take.
        </p>
        <p>Lord, I pray this but am so short of faith that I don't believe,
            even as I pray. Would you give me the faith to have hope and believe?
            Lord, would you heal me physically and mentally and most importantly, spiritually Lord?
        </p>
        <p>
            Lord, would you show me what you see in me? I don't see a lick of goodness in me.
            Lord, I know that all my goodness is from You, but when I see myself without You or your goodness,
            I am so worthless and weak. Could you give me the faith to know that even if I am this way,
            You will pull me through?
