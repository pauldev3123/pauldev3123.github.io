        <h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
        <h2>1/23/26</h2>
        <p>Today, I am feeling thankful because I woke up in the morning.
            Then, I went on a run and called my mom.
            I am also thankful for the great food I was able to eat,
            and that I was not in despair. Even when I'm tired, I
            should not give up trying to be the best version of myself. For that,
            I am thankful.
