        <h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
        <h2>1/23/26</h2>
        <p>Today, I am feeling thankful because I woke up in the morning.
            Then, I went on a run and called my mom.
            I am also thankful for the great food I was able to eat,
            and that I was not in despair. Even when I'm tired, I
            should not give up trying to be the best version of myself. For that,
            I am thankful.
        </p>
        <h1>1/26/26</h1>
        <p>
            The last few days I was so physically sick and in despair.
            I am thankful because I woke up today feeling a bit better.
            I also had more clarity, so I am thankful for that.
            I am thankful that I had a dream about my sister that in the middle of the night
            I felt love and remembered my family and what matters to me.
            I am thankful that I am able to lead an extraordinary Life
            with extraordinary people by my side.
            I ams so thankful that I was born into my family, for that is the gift
            that keeps me going through the toughest times of my life.
        </p>

            Lord, I pray that today you will fill me with joy that doesn't depreciate.
            Lord, I have been so depressed that I have ran out of tears.
            Lord, I know that my faith and righteous actions have dwindled,
            but I believe that you will make me better.
            I need to believe that because I see that otherwise there is no hope.
            It is not about escaping here and being good in NY, I want to be blessed by You 
            in every single step that I take.
        </p>
        <p>Lord, I pray this but am so short of faith that I don't believe,
            even as I pray. Would you give me the faith to have hope and believe?
            Lord, would you heal me physically and mentally and most importantly, spiritually Lord?
        </p>
        <p>
            Lord, would you show me what you see in me? I don't see a lick of goodness in me.
            Lord, I know that all my goodness is from You, but when I see myself without You or your goodness,
            I am so worthless and weak. Could you give me the faith to know that even if I am this way,
            You will pull me through?
        </p>
				<p> Lord I thank you for the clarity you brought me today. I had the best day Ive had since Ive been home last month. You took me from despair and depression and destruction to finally to be able to see a glimmer of light in front of me. Lord would uou lead me so that I get closer to the light? Lord may I hold your hand and walk there with faith that I wont be blinded? Lord thank you for the love you have poured into me. I have been so oblivious and numb to notice. Help me be more sensitive to it. Lord thank you for the tears you have let me cry today. Inbelieve that you count each of my tears. Lord help me never forget I am always at your mercy. Lord from the morning you called me and showed me love rhough visions of my sister. And even amidst my dark hours, you showed me grace and love. When I was at work, you taught me and looked after me. Lord I have not been doing my duties but you have been guding me. You have been holding my hand. How could I forget?
