        <h1>Dreams</h1>
        <p>Small dream: I had a literal dream of giving my sister a birthday present.
            I want to get her a matcha package maybe. But as an extension, I never
            want to miss my sister's bday ever again. She is so precious Lord.
        </p>
        <p>Small dream: I want to like myself. I isolate myself when even I can't love myself.
            But I need to remember that there are people that see the best version of myself,
            one that hasn't even developed yet. But they love me so much as to
            delusionally believe in this version of myself.
            I owe it to these people to be the best version of myself, and I need to like myself
            before I can get to that stage.
        </p>
        <p>Big dream: I want my sister to not have to worry about college tuition.
            I want her to live everyday with fulfillment, maybe as a contrast to myself.
        </p>
        <p>In order to achieve these dreams, I need to be a stronger man.
            I need to be a better son, and a better brother, and a better friend. amd person.
        </p>
				<p> That my ideas from this garden can really sprout and be used in my successful web portfolio one day God willing.
