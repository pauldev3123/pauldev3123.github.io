        <h1>Sleepify AI</h1>

						<h2> For My Sister Grace</h2>
							<p>I want to make Gracie her own website, where I give her an interface where she can write her own journal entries, or upload pictures of it. Maybe give her a tool like being able to add stuff like links of her shopping list on shopping websites- like a shopping wishlist. The specifics and details can be worked out gradually and thoroughly. Give her a place where she can write feedback for me for my dev development.
							</p>
							<p>Not necessarily a Dev Idea per se, but a pull out the weeds function where if I write a dreams entry and I end up rambling abour life or basically writing a journal entry, a function that can "pull out the weeds" and maybe store it someplace else. maybe AI incroportated who knows</p>
        <h1>Podcast AI</h1>
        <p>I need help finding podcast episodes that I would enjoy.
            I end up watching the same episodes again sometimes,
            or end up just wanting to listen to music.
            Books I can not comprehend and stay on track of to really suck in the information.
            Podcasts are more about the energy and the "nerdiness" of the topics discussed,
            and I end up learning just as much if not more on podcasts.
        </p>
				<h1>Nutrition AI</h1>
				<p>Depending on what you ate and log, recommendations based on goals and remaining calories and protein etc. Meals or even micro things such as ingredients and foods i can add to my diet for balance maybe based on cronometer.Cronometer API?</p>
        <h1>Combat Manager (CM)</h1>
        <p>Like Football Manager, there are attributes and simulated fights.
            Not sure how exactly tbh.
