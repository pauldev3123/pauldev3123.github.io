						<h2> For My Sister Grace</h2>
							<p>I want to make Gracie her own website, where I give her an interface where she can write her own journal entries, or upload pictures of it. Maybe give her a tool like being able to add stuff like links of her shopping list on shopping websites- like a shopping wishlist. The specifics and details can be worked out gradually and thoroughly. Give her a place where she can write feedback for me for my dev development.
							</p>
							<p>Not necessarily a Dev Idea per se, but a pull out the weeds function where if I write a dreams entry and I end up rambling abour life or basically writing a journal entry, a function that can "pull out the weeds" and maybe store it someplace else. maybe AI incroportated who knows</p>
