    <p>I wokeup at like 2pm, and slowely showered and ate some eggs and rice,
        and bone broth. Its already 5:30pm about time to go to work.
        At work, I will try to love on others and remember Jesus's love for me.
        I think I will listen to Cal Newport's Slow Productivity at work.
        Remember, even when bored, it is not a waste of time. That is my time to be creative.
        Don't waste thoughts and not letting them finish because of my weed urges.
        I will not bring my pen to work today, like I did not yesterday.

    <p>11:59pm I just showered after work. Feeling good.
        At work, I was able to be loving to people today.
        I felt good, yes I was craving weed, but I was able to withhold.
        Now I hit the pen few times and will eat something light maybe.
        I felt quite sick by the end of the shift, and my stomach has been feeling a bit uneasy.
