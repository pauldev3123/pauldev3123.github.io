    <p>I wokeup at like 2pm, and slowely showered and ate some eggs and rice,
        and bone broth. Its already 5:30pm about time to go to work.
        At work, I will try to love on others and remember Jesus's love for me.
        I think I will listen to Cal Newport's Slow Productivity at work.
        Remember, even when bored, it is not a waste of time. That is my time to be creative.
        Don't waste thoughts and not letting them finish because of my weed urges.
        I will not bring my pen to work today, like I did not yesterday.
