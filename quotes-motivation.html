        <h2>The martial courage of the solider.
            The mental courage of the scientist.
        </h2>
        <h3>Persist and Resist.</h3>
        <p>Thoughts of being good to my mom and my sister, and my dad and my brother.
            Remember Jesus said even tax collectors love their kin.
            Can I try to extend that to other people?
        </p>
        <p>Today, I will be mindful of the habits I am setting for myself.
            Every action/inaction builds a habit, be it a good habit or a bad habit.
            This ties into persist and resist, and being more mindful and then intentional about my actions.
        </p>
        <p>Will I trade my sufferings- physical, mental, emotional, spiritual - 
            for mental illness? Am I brave enough to suffer?
            Do I have faith that God will make things better?
        </p>
        <p>My mom said none of these tears or sufferings will go to waste.
            Remember that whenever I want to numb the pain.
            The pain is what will make me stronger.
