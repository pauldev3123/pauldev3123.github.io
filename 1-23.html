        <p>It is currently 12:07pm. I have started the day well.
            After waking up and pooping a bit, I went to the gym to run a bit.
            My legs are very out of shape. I will take the next few weeks to get back into shape and
            track my progress a bit.
        </p>
        <p>However, I shouldn't wait to be in shape to get back to bjj.
            I will have to tone down on the weed and start waking up earlier.
        </p>
        <p>1:48pm just ate 소금구이 새우 and with the shrimp heads,
            I sauteed with butter and minced garlic.
            With rice, 10/10 meal. Am thankful, will try to remain that way today.

        </p>
