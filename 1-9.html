	<h1>1/9/2026</h1>
	<p> I woke up at about 1pm today. The last few days I have been waking up just before work and just been high and depressed the whole week. Today, I felt some motivation and seek to know the Lord. I pray that I am able to not leave regrets behind in SD as my time here dwindles. </p>

	<p> I will slowly work on making my website better, adding a forecast section that previews the next day and plan, maybe trying to incorporate my morning and night routine. HOWEVER, it is about sticking to it, not just planning it.</p>

	<p> It is about 3:42pm and I have to eat lunch and just chill until work. Tomorrow I will maybe play soccer and I also have a meeting with Austin at dinner. Do not be high for that meeting and try to think of things to say to him about leaving.</p>

	<p> I also have to buy a screwdriver and try to pack and see what to throw out as well this weekend.
