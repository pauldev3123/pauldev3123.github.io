        <p>
            I woke up at about 12:30pm today. The last few days I have been very sick.
            Today, I feel much better except the congestion and cough.
            I am eating blueberries and honey, bone broth, and coffee.
            I just merged the journal and emotional weather forecast
            sections on the website because I think both come together.

            I called my mom outside and that was great. I told her about the dream
            I had of giving Grace her birthday present last night.
            I remember last night, how much I sought to be back with my family.
            Soon I will be back, so stay strong and get stronger before getting home.
            I really really need to step up now.

            I will actually simplify my website a lot further by just having daily journal section and 
            a tools section, and get rid of the routine and nutrition sections.
            All that can go into my journal entries.

            Since I'm sick, I will try to use the pen less.
            I am likely to be triggered more at work.
            Remember to have good temperature at the store and drink my tea and broth.
            Remember to look at my thansgiving and remember my mom more.
            Remember that just because I am far from the people that I love,
            that the love doesn't exist or is any weaker. Their existence
            strengthens me and urges me to push on.

            I came back from a ~30min walk at 3:50pm. I feel good, not too tired,
            but my body is still weak so I will take care of myself today.

            I have been getting spiteful thoughts about the people around me today,
            but I will have to tone that down. I need other things to think about,
            so as to not default to being spiteful in my mind or through my words.

            There are always always always gonna be things to complain about,
            especially in this house, BUT there are always more things to be thankful about,
            that I am forgetting. In these times, take time to meditate and think about the blessings.
            
            If I am stuck at being spiteful, remind myself by visitng my website and looking at the thansgiving.
