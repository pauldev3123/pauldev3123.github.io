        <p>
            I woke up at about 12:30pm today. The last few days I have been very sick.
            Today, I feel much better except the congestion and cough.
            I am eating blueberries and honey, bone broth, and coffee.
            I just merged the journal and emotional weather forecast
            sections on the website because I think both come together.

            I will actually simplify my website a lot further by just having daily journal section and 
            a tools section, and get rid of the routine and nutrition sections.
            All that can go into my journal entries.
