		<h1> 12/28 Journal Entry </h1>
		<p> I want this journal to be a place for me to jot down raw thoughts, ideas, or anything I feel like I should write down. I could care less about formatting or aesthetics on here, but maybe at the end of each week, I can compile my week's entries a bit nicer. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO BE HONEST AND PRESENT IN THIS.
		</p>
		<p>I am up at 4:16am, after a Saturday of just rotting in bed and hitting my weed pen. I had too much caffeine at night and know I cannot fall asleep unfil at least dawn. The last few hours, I spent doom scrolling, feeling like noting in this life gives me joy. I was covered in dark, stormy clouds. As Marie Antoinnete said, "Nothing tastes..." Then, I started thinking about things that give light to my life. My family, friends, and activites that I am passionate about, passionate without indulging in addictive and compulsive behavior. After a day of lusting, hitting the pen, and hating, all of which I hoped will fill the deep void in my heart and soul, not any of these vices give me the temporary release they used to.
		</p>
		<p> This is not meant to be a fix-all solution for these things. Like I emphasized, this space is just a space for me to be honest and present and look at myself from a larger frame. I imagine I will be writing entries after work most days. Perhaps I can write down my activities from the day and include pictures if I have any. Even just writing this does give me an option to reflect and reset, which I know I neglect to do and should practice doing. This could be the start of something signigicant, or it may not. Perfection isn't what this is gonna be about, this will be about the progress.

			<u>After all, sometimes it rains in the garden. Some plants die, while others grow.</u>
					If I worry so much about the plants that keep dying or about the plants that aren't growing fast enough, I tend to forget to be grateful.
		</p>
		<p>Over the next few days and weeks, I urge myself to think about my purpose. Too many days, I wake up without a purpose and struggle (or even worse, neglect to struggle and choose to numb myself). What is my purpose? What plants do I want to grow in the garden? What weeds must I pull out from the earth? Who shall I invite to my garden?
		</p>
		<p>It is 5:40am and I just finalized the very first edition of my webpage, much thanks to my little Scrimba experience and help from google gemini AI. I take another hit and maybe try to wind down. I don't feel as miserable and purposeless as even an hour or so ago. This makes me sure of one thing: I am purpose-driven, and having no purpose means I have no drive. How can I have no drive when so much is on my shoulders?
			
		</p>
		<p>Knowing I have a lot on my shoulders is one thing, but also being able to take a step back and be proud of my work and progress is another. Keep trying to be positive and be nice to myself! Today I took a step in the right direction, and because of that, I an proud of myself.
