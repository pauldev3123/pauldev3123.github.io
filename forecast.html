	<h1>1/22/26</h1>
	<p>I have work in like 2 hours.
		I will eat something and bring some food to work.
		I feel a bit sick so I can bring some tea as well.
		Let me try to avoid hitting the pen until after work today.
		I need to start eating healthier and start caring more.
	</p>
	<p>
		At work, even if I get tired or demoralized, be thankful and meditate on God's word.
