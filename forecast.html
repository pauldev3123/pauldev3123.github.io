	<h1>1/23/26</h1>
	<p> I started the day off well, but do not get my tiredness
		give into being a hater or being ungrateful. Live gratefully today.
	</p>
	<p>I called my mom in the morning so I feel more hopeful and energized.
		REMEMBER that my mom is always praying for me, and hoping
		I can be the best version of myself every fleeting moment.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a lot of time until work, so do not fall into lust or gloom.
		Have fun cooking, and enjoy my rest and maybe even go on a walk later and stretch.
	</p>
	<p>At work, I should have some tea and some chicken broth to sip.
		It is Friday, so EXPECT some HASSLE, but persist and resist till the end.
	</p>
	<p>1:49pm just ate and am full, my legs feel tired but not too bad.
		I am gonna rest and in a bit, hopefully get to coding.
