	<h1>Today's weather</h1>
	<p>I woke up today at around 9am to pee. After I felt well rested and had clarity but decided to go back to bed. Then, I slowly woke up at around 1pm and was groggy for a bit. Then, I cleaned up a bit and took a few hits. I listened to the Bible and tried to be more present with God today. (4:06pm)</p>

	<h1>The Rest of Today's Weather</h1>
	<p>I will eat something and shower and go to work. I had a mean headache at work yesterday and could barely breathe through my nose yesterday. So, today I will try not to hit the pen too much.</p>
	<p>At work, I will listen to and meditate on God's Word. I do not want to be in despair at work and will work hard tonight because that is one of my values. </p>

	<h1>Tomorrow's Weather Forecast</h1>
	<p>Add at night</p>
	<h1>1/12/26</h1>
	<p>I ate pork belly today and did some coding. Not proud of my progress, but proud to be progressing. Let me slowly build some mome tum for myself. Bringing blueberries and PB powder to work, so I should not be hungry.</p>
	<p> At work, be nice to everyone. Think of my mother and father, think of my brother and sister. Think of God more and less of myself.</p>
