		<h2>At work</h2>
		<p>re-listened to the Huberman episode ft Dr Anna from yesterday at 1.5x speed.
			It served as a good reminder for the things I need to be cautious of,
			and it helped that I left the pen at home so at work I was intent on focusing on this.
			It naturally didnt feel as insightful as it did yesterday, but still worth
			the listen. Maybe not again tomorrow, but fuck it maybe.

		</p>
		<p>I then listened to the first half of the Jocko podcast ft Dean Lister.
			I liked it thus far because it was a conversation of the pair sharing memories
			and how they improved each other. I like conversational and lighthearted podcasts 
			especially about the topics that I like. These two also don't get too carried away or political
			and seem to just enjoy talking to each other. I was a bit inspired by how nonchalantly they talked
			about the brutal training they did. It was like it was insignificant to them,
			if it meant they can achieve their goal. I want to be strong like these men.
